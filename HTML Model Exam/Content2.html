            <h1>Benjamin Hornigold</h1>
            <img id="pic" src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/711x400/https://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2014/06/kenway.jpg?width=960" width="350px" height="200px" alt="Scott Sampson">
            <p>Shortly before his death, Blackbeard became the second-in-command for Benjamin Hornigold, 
                another real-life pirate who appears in ACL Black Flag. Hornigold was cautious and refused to attack British ships,
                which frustrated his crew and caused them to vote him out as captain, according to the Queen Anne's Revenge Project.
                Eventually, Hornigold was pardoned by the king and became a pirate hunter,
                turning on his former acquaintances to help out the governor of the Bahamas. 
                According to 1724's disputed A General History of the Pyrates, he died in a shipwreck.</p>
                <h2>Stede Bonnet</h2>
                <p>Unlike most other pirates, Stede Bonnet was born into a fairly well-off family before becoming an outlaw. However,
                     in 1717, Bonnet decided to turn to a life of crime, buying a ship, which he named Revenge, according to Smithsonian Magazine.
                      He set sail for the Caribbean, where he met Blackbeard. The two worked together for a few years, although Bonnet's crew eventually abandoned him for Blackbeard,
                       who was a much more competent captain. In the summer of 1718,
                     Captain William Rhett of South Carolina pursued Bonnet for capture, and Bonnet was executed on December 10, 1718.</p>

          <h2>Charles Vane</h2>
          <nav>
            Last but not least on the list is Charles Vane, who began his piracy career around 1716, 
            according to The Way of the Pirates. In 1719 or 1720, Vane's ship was marooned by a hurricane in the Bay of Honduras, 
            and a passing British ship arrested him, bringing him to Port Royal in Jamaica. He was executed in November of 1720.
             Unlike some of the other pirates featured in AC: Black Flag, Vane was known for his cruelty,
             and he often tortured and killed soldiers who were stationed on the ships he captured.
